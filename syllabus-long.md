## Course Description 

**The aim of the course** is to have a look under the hood of programming languages. How do programming languages work? Could you design your own programming language? Instead of looking at particular examples of programming languages, we will build our own. It will be a small language and the implementation will not be efficient, but we will be able to understand in all detail how it works. 

Next semester, in Compiler Construction, we will demonstrate that the principles we learn this semester also apply to industrial scale programming languages such as C++. 

**Prerequisites:** (MATH 250, CPSC 350) I assume that you know at least one, ideally a few more, programming languages. It would also be good to have learned something about computer architecture. One theme of the course is how to bridge the gap between a programming language and the actual machine, so some awareness of how actual machines work is needed to fully appreciate the material. Finally, while I will introduce the mathematics that we need to engineer our programming languages, some ability in manipulating formal mathematical models as typically acquired in a discrete mathematics or introductory logic course will be needed.

Note that this has been (slightly) modified from the current [course catalogue](https://catalog.chapman.edu/content.php?catoid=11&navoid=556).

See also the [Fowler School of Engineering Program Learning Outcomes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OESCtPUolnWFV_qRFuRzNrzxmUtYr5H-dFaYVmPUKY0/edit?usp=sharing).


After completing this course, students will be able to

- explain how an interpreter for a small functional and imperative programming languages work
- use a context-free grammar and a parser generator such as BNFC 
- add features of their own to the languages and interpreters
- explain syntax and semantics of various calculi and programming languages
- understand lambda-calculus as a foundation of programming languages and the concepts of operational and denotational semantics
- explain various features of programming languages based on the computational model of term-rewriting
- define and prove basic properties of term-rewriting systems
- understand the significance of abstract and algebraic data types and their relationship to universal algebra
- explain the basic principles of program verification
- use well-founded orders in termination proofs of simple programs
- use invariants in partial correctness proof of simple programs
- write Haskell programs that use recursion over algebraic data types

Moreover, students will be able to acquire the basic ideas of advanced topics such as theorem proving, dependent types and mathematics as a specification and programming language.

Finally, students will learn to appreciate that mathematics is not only important for developers who create the tools used in everyday engineering practice, but also that the knowledge of the mathematical concepts and results underpinning these engineering tools impact everyday engineering practice (and increase your chances to pass a coding interview). I discuss some aspects of this in a these notes on [mathematics as a programming language](https://hackmd.io/s/ByGLTvFDE).

## Overview 

Together with Compiler Construction this course is the first one of a pair of courses in which we are going to learn the basic theory and practice of designing and implementing a programming language.

#### Summary

The course will have a practical and a theoretical component.

- *The theoretical component* will teach some of the mathematics underpinning the design of programming languages. These will include some of the basics of logic, rewriting, ordered structures, universal algebra, and category theory (type theory will be deferred to next semester's course on compiler construction). Just enough theory to help the writing of interpreters and to gain an outlook on some of the questions guiding programming languages research. I made a [list of theoretical concepts](theory.md) that appear regularly in programming languages blogs and which we will learn about something. 

- *The practical component* will be about building interpreters for small programming languages. We will start with a calculator, that is, an interpreter for the language of high-school arithmetic, then go on to the smallest proper programming language known as lambda calculus. Lambda calculus provides variables and functions and other programming languages can be seen as extensions of lambda calculus. Thus, once we have an interpreter for lambda caclulus, we will approximate more realistic programming languages by extending lambda calculus: conditionals, recursion, data types, assignment, while loops, addresses (pointers), memory allocation, dereferencing, arrays. There will be room for invention and adventure if you feel like it. But there will also be many guided exercises.

#### Detailed Description

The course is divided in a practical and theoretical component. 

On the practical side, students will learn 
- the basics of Haskell
- how to build interpreters in Haskell for small programming languages of increasing complexity:
  - numbers, addition, multipliciation, fractions, ...
  - calculator
  - lambda-calculus
  - a small functional programming language
  - a small imperative programming language

This will include the basics of parsing and the use of a parser generator. The aim is to treat programming languages that only have a small number of features. We will see that these methods scale in next semester's course on compiler construction.

On the theoretical side, students will learn the fundamental ideas of

- lambda calculus
- operational and denotational semantics    
- term rewriting   
- invariants and well-founded orders     
- program verification and Hoare logic    
- structural induction, universal algebra, and category theory    

On the way, students will encounter different programming languages such as Dafny and Haskell and , if time permits, Lisp (Scheme), theorem provers such as Isabelle, dependently typed programming languages such as Idris as well as programming concepts such as algebraic data types, recursion, variable binding, polymorphism, and more.

During the course we will pay special attention to compositionality. For example, from a software engineering point of view, we see compositionality in the division between syntax and semantics, or, parsing and interpretation; the programming technique of recursion over abstract syntax trees is another incarnation; in program verification, we will separate termination from partial correctness, which will allow us to give a compositional calculus for program verification known as Hoare logic.

## Required Text

The technical content of the course will be distributed via github. For general background I recommend to read the book Goedel-Escher-Bach.

## Course Materials 

All course materials will be made available via github.

## Assessment

Assessment will be divided in a total of 200 points.

- 3 programming [assignments](assignments.md) each worth 30 points (90 points total)

- Participation worth 10 points.

- A report worth 100 points.

## Course Grade Breakdown

Grading scale used for the course:

| Percentage | Letter |
|---|---|
| 90 |	A |
| 80-89 | 	B |
| 70-79	| C |
| 60-69	| D |
| < 60 |	F |

You must score a 70 or above to receive a P when taking the course P/NP.

## Late Policy
If you need more time for an assignment 
- convince me that you already have done substantial work (for example by showing me the code in your GitHub repository);
- explain the special circumstances that would allow me to justify giving you more time.

(The two points above need to be acted upon before the deadline.)

## Participation

- It is expected that students attend every lecture and participate in the Discussion Forum. 
- I also appreciate if students make use of the office hours, which gives me valuable feedback on how the class is going.
